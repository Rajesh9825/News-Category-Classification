# News Category Classification  

## Project Overview  
This project classifies news articles into different categories like Business,Science and Technology, Entertainment, Health using Machine Learning. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset and deployed as a simple Streamlit web app for easy interaction.  

## Features  
* Automatically classifies news articles into predefined categories.  
* Uses TF-IDF for text representation and Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification.  
* Achieves 92% accuracy on test data.  
* Built a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Multinomial Naive Bayes 
- **NLP Techniques**: Text Cleaning, TF-IDF, BOW 

## Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled news articles (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/news-aggregator-dataset). Future improvements may involve scraping real-world news data.
